The Long Night of the Sciences has become an established form of public relations activity in Germany. One night of the year, large scientific institutions hold lectures and dmeonstrations for the general public in order to present themselves and a general overview of their research topics. The events cover all aspects of science, from natural sciences to social sciences. The public can usually visit the insitutions around 5pm and 1am on the 'Long Night of Sciences' in exchange for a fee.   

## The SLaM Lab at NDW - The role of Linguistics in AI for Social Good
How can a computer detect Parkinson's Disease from a voice recording? Or determine is a person has had too much too drink? What do we need to build voice assistants that can understand diverse voice? With the growing role of language technologies in our lives, we need to build tools that are both intelligent and equitable, in order to meet diverse needs of linguistically-diverse populations. Guests will learn about the intersection between linguistics and AI through hands-on demonstartions. What linguistic principles underlie these challenges, and how can these be computationally implements? Such systems range from familiar virtual assistants, to non-invasive screening for neuromuscular disorders, to particular populations. How can we improve these systems for the public good? 


### Virtual Health Assistants: Usage and Problems 
Virtual health assistants are virtual people we can have conversations with. They can help by asking guiding questions or giving instructions, which makes them particularly useful for people who feel shame or embarrassment asking other people for help. Among u√≥ther things, this is useful for preventive talks or screenings, for breast cancer, testicular cancer or for urine samples. 

AIs of this kind have to be trained with language data, so that they can recognize the 'patterns' of a language. In a best case scenario, the data is carefully selected, altough often, language data from majority languages is used. This way the AI only recognizes a standard variety of a language and it cannot understand certain dialects and minority languages. These people thus do not have the same opportunity and access to virtual health assistants, and other applications using automated speech recognition. To combat the discrimination of minority languages, we ought to collect more language data on these languages and make them more accessible to researches working on AI and related tech.
